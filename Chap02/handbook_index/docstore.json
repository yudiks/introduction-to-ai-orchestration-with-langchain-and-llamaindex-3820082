OCTOBER 25, 2023\n\n\n\nAuthored and approved by:\n\nDahlia Landon, President and CEO\n\nJonathan Perfington, President and Managing Director, North America\n\nHarold Wandalere, EVP and General Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Story Behind THE Landon Hotel \n\nThe values that Mr. Landon held so dear to his heart, were evidently values that appealed to travelers the world over. The Landon advertised luxurious modern comforts and conveniences, backed by warm, sincere customer service, where guests were treated as friends. Mr. Landon, himself, liked to say \u201cWe\u2019re upscale, not uppity - and refined, not pretentious.\u201d But, most importantly, The Landon philosophy all came down to mirroring the individuality of each neighborhood within the walls of the hotel. With so many hotels within in his realm, Mr. Landon was adamant that none of the hotels should look alike, but instead that they must each take on the personality of their individual locations. He remained ardently true to his original vision until the day he died in August 1998. \n\nStill, at its core, Landon Hotel remains a community based, focusing on the specific needs of individuals and organizations in each community in which its hotels are located. \n\nThank you for your interest in Landon Hotel. We hope you enjoy our products and invite you to send us your comments and suggestions by email to feedback@landonhotel.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDahlia Landon & the Entire Landon Hotel family \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\tThe Story Behind THE Landon Hotel\t2\n\n\tSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION\t5\n\n\t1.1 CHANGES IN POLICY\t5\n\n\t1.2 EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS\t5\n\n\t1.3 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\t5\n\n\tSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYEES STATUS\t5\n\n\t2.1 \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d DEFINED\t5\n\n\t2.2 EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1765, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9c0cd38-1185-46a5-93fa-37c403144191": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9c0cd38-1185-46a5-93fa-37c403144191", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "/Users/yudi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/COURSE/AI-Orchestration/introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082/Chap02/handbook/Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2024-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b73db92-346f-4b5d-a33b-47acf41f48de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "/Users/yudi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/COURSE/AI-Orchestration/introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082/Chap02/handbook/Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2024-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-16"}, "hash": "28fd9c9f66f5b0362273256792213bec7ad544bdd44e4406f357b5836e35cb96", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2352666-dc47-423f-aa13-3c733e745175", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "/Users/yudi/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/COURSE/AI-Orchestration/introduction-to-ai-orchestration-with-langchain-and-llamaindex-3820082/Chap02/handbook/Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 246345, "creation_date": "2024-05-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-16"}, "hash": "0e227e128ad72448297d9d3c06f82e7124e25428db36f7248d729e9e2c41fc5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3733f81a-2c07-425d-b66a-75b00001c26a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ec2cb20ad470ba2ad3af92b34d57c1852b52f8410ce57f8f3d1f9b1424542d50", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\t5\n\n\tSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYEES STATUS\t5\n\n\t2.1 \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d DEFINED\t5\n\n\t2.2 EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.3 NON-EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.4 REGULAR FULL-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.5 REGULAR PART-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.6 TEMPORARY (FULL-TIME or PART-TIME)\t6\n\n\t2.7 PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEW EMPLOYEES\t6\n\n\tSECTION 3: EMPLOYMENT POLICIES\t6\n\n\t3.1 anti-harrassment and NON-DISCRIMINATION\t6\n\n\t3.2 NON-DISCLOSURE/CONFIDENTIALITY\t7\n\n\t3.3 NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION\t7\n\n\t3.4 PROBATIONARY PERIOD FOR NEW EMPLOYEES\t8\n\n\t3.5 OFFICE HOURS\t8\n\n\t3.6 LUNCH PERIODS\t8\n\n\t3.7 BREAK PERIODS\t8\n\n\t3.8 PERSONNEL FILES\t8\n\n\t3.9 PERSONNEL DATA CHANGES\t9\n\n\t3.10 INCLEMENT WEATHER/EMERGENCY CLOSINGS\t9\n\n\t3.11 EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE REVIEW AND PLANNING SESSIONS\t9\n\n\t3.12 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT\t10\n\n\t3.13 CORRECTIVE ACTION\t10\n\n\t3.14 EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION\t10\n\n\t3.15 SAFETY\t11\n\n\t3.16 HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES\t11\n\n\t3.17 EMPLOYEE REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION\t12\n\n\t3.18 BUILDING SECURITY\t12\n\n\t3.19 INSURANCE ON PERSONAL EFFECTS\t12\n\n\t3.20 SUPPLIES;

Supervisors may conduct informal performance reviews and planning sessions more often if they choose. \n\nPerformance reviews and planning sessions are designed for the supervisor and the employee to discuss their current job tasks, encourage and recognize attributes, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting work-related goals. Together, employee and supervisor discuss ways in which the employee can accomplish goals or learn new skills. The planning sessions are designed for the employee and their supervisor to make and agree on new goals, skills, and areas for improvement.\n\nLandon Hotel directly links wage and salary increases with performance. Your performance review and planning sessions will have a direct effect on any changes in your compensation. For this reason, among others, it is important to prepare for these reviews carefully, and participate in them fully.\n\nNew employees will be reviewed at the end of their probationary periods (see Section 3.4, Probationary Period for New Employees). After the initial review, the employee will be reviewed according to the regular semi-annual schedule.\n\n3.12 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT\n\nEmployees may hold outside jobs in non-related businesses or professions if the employee meets the performance standards of their job description with Landon Hotel.
